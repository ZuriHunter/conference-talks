# Conference Talks
This repository will serve as my destination where I will hold talks that will fall under my name.  The talks will fall in a range of front-end, back-end, design, career, negotiation, and mentorship. I plan on to use the reveal.js javascript framework to deliver my talks for which it will be great way presentation wise for code highlighting syntax and for deliver my talks through the web.

## To create a presentation run:
`npm run create-presentation`  The script will clone the reveal.js repository, change into the directory of that repository,and remove the`.git` file. Please remember to select "Yes" when modifying or overwriting any of the git objects.  For future development that script will be modified to the point where it will change the name of directory the title of presentation.
